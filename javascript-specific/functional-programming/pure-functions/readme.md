# Pure Functions

- Pure functions are functions that take inputs and return the output value without affecting any variable outside of their scope. This means they donâ€™t have any side effects on any of the data outside their scope.
- Predictable

- These functions must return a value

- The return value must depend on the input arguments passed.
