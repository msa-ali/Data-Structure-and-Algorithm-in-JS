/*
    Enable the user to view the top-rated movies worldwide, 
    given that we have movie rankings available separately for different geographic regions.

    Now, we need to build a criterion so the top movies from multiple countries will combine into a single list
    of top-rated movies. In order to scale, the content search is performed in a distributed fashion. 
    Search results for each country are produced in separate lists. 
    Each member of a given list is ranked by popularity, with 1 being most popular and popularity decreasing
    as the rank number increases.

    Weâ€™ll be given n lists that are all sorted in ascending order of popularity rank. 
    We have to combine these lists into a single list that will be sorted by rank in ascending order, 
    meaning from best to worst.

    List 1: 11 -> 23 -> 32 -> 38

    List 2: 1 -> 44

    List 3: 23 -> 57 -> 99

    Result: 1 -> 11 -> 23 -> 23 -> 32 -> 38 -> 44 -> 57 -> 99
