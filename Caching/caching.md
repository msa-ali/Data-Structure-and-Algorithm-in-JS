## Caching

- Caching is the process of storing data into temporary memory so that it can be easily retrieved for later use if it is required again.

- In caching ,the goal is to maximise hits(an item is in the cache when requested) and minimize misses( an item is not in the cache when requested).

- Cache design generally considers two factors:
  1. Temporal Locality - A memory location that has been recently accessed is likely to be access again
  2. Spatial Locality - A memory location near one that has recently been accessed is likely to be accessed again.

## Two caching techniques

1. Least Frequently Used ( LFU )
2. Least Recently Used ( LRU )

## Least Frequently Used ( LFU )

- It is a caching algorithm used by OS to manage memory. The system tracks the number of times a block is referenced in the memory.

- By design, when the cache exceeds its limit, the system deletes the item with the lowest reference frequency.

- LFU is uncommon as when an item in memory is referened repeatedly for a short amt of time, the frequency for that block is high but this forces the system to delete other blocks tht may be used more frequently outside the short block of time. Also new items in the system are susceptible to being deleted quickly because of their lower frequency of being accessed.

- SOME USECASE OF LFU - MOBILE KEYBOARD APPS. Suggested words appear on the keyboard apps and it makes sense to implement this using LFU caching since the user likely uses the same words often.

## Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Least Recently Used (LRU) is a common caching strategy. 
- It defines the policy to evict elements from the cache to make room for new elements when the cache is full, meaning it discards the least recently used items first.
- Implemented using
  - Doubly linked list
  - Hashing

Ex: Let’s take an example of a cache that has a capacity of 4 elements. We cache elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.

  `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

  LRU Cache state after first access of all four elements i.e. '1', '2', '3', '4' in the same sequence

  The diagram above represents the cache state after first access of all four elements. We now need to cache another element “5”.

  `[2, 3, 4, 5]` - LRU Cache state after we access another element '5'

  In LRU cache, we evict the least recently used element (in this case “1”) in case a new element needs to be cached. Now “2” is next in line to be evicted if a new element needs to be cached. Let’s see what happens when “2” is accessed again.

  `[3, 4, 5, 2]` - LRU Cache state after we access element '2' again

  Now “3” becomes the next in line to be evicted from the cache.
